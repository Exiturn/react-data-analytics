# My Process


### Built With

- [React]
- [TailwindCSS]
- [Framer Motion]






# Lessons Learned

This project was a fun learning experience, being able to transition from React to Next.js was an eye-opener in terms of project structure and optimization.

## TailwindCSS
Nothing new to say about my favourite CSS framework. Once I started I couldn't stop. Being my first CSS framework, I always have a soft spot for Tailwind, I know there are other, newer frameworks like Bulma but the ease of use that Tailwind provides, especially as a developer, is hard to replace.

## React
This project wasn't my first in React but it felt nice to continue to consolidate my knowledge of frontend development with React. Continuing to deepen my knowledge of hooks was the main takeaway from this project.

## Framer Motion
GSAP vs Framer Motion is a title I see quite a lot on youtube when looking for the animation libraries. Having used both now, I can say I don't have a preference. Not that both are bad but that both are equally as good and important in different ways. I see Framer motion as a library that works well with mounting/unmounting animations and sharing animation states between components with its animateShareLayout feature, whereas GSAP is great for chaining animations together with its Timeline functionality, but combining both would bring the best of both worlds in one. I will definitely be working on a project in the future that utilises both!
